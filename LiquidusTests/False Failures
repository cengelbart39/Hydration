Unit Tests False Failures
------

Some Unit Tests utilize Date.now
This use can cause Unit Tests to sometimes fail when the expected return and sample drinks are set relative to Date.now
Rerunning the failed test(s) can resolve the issue

Example:
Say you run some test that utlizies Date.now
At the time of running it is 5:30:59

The Sample Drinks use 5:30:59
The Expected Result uses 5:31:00

Causes the test to fail as the minute isn't the same between both sets of Drinks

The same thing could happen with the hour as well.
